                    The first country I had ever been to was Chili. I went there for a 
                    sports cometition where I competed on the USA JR. World team for women's wrestling. 
                    It was an amazing experience and many friends were made during the trip. My favorite part of the 
                    trip was all the unique and amazing food that the country had.

                    The second country I went to was Mexico. I actually lived in mexico for two years where I was given the 
                    oppertunity to see many parts of the country, meet many amazing people and try all their amazing
                    cuisine that they had to offer.

                    The third country that I visited was England. I went to England with my rugby team to play a team
                    up in Preston, England. We got to see most of London and many parts of the country side. We took
                    a train to travel to the northern part of England were we met the Preston Grasshoppers to play rugby.

                    The final country that I have visited is Scotland. Scotland was beautiful and the people there were 
                    very welcoming and lovely. During our trip through Scottland we rented a car and drove up into the Scottish
                    Highlands. We were not able to go all the way up north, but we made it to as far as Inverness. Scottland 
                    is by far my favorite country I have ever been to.
